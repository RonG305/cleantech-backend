🧹 On-Demand Cleaning Services Platform (Microservices)

This project is an Uber-like on-demand cleaning services platform built using NestJS microservices architecture.
It connects customers who need cleaning services with nearby available cleaners in real time.

The system allows users to request cleaning services, select service types and quantities, and automatically matches them with the nearest qualified cleaner who can accept the job.
